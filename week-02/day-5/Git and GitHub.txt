GIT AND GITHUB

- git is a version-control piece of software
- it runs locally on your machine
- you can save out multiple versions of a project
- you can checkout different versions and work on them separately
- you have the ability to roll back to earlier versions, merge versions, selectively add things to other versions, branch off, etc.

- GitHub is an online code repository
- it can back up your local software
- it also easily enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase

COMMANDS
git clone -- clone a remote repo from GitHub to your machine

// the following commands require that you've navigated to inside the repo folder

git pull -- pulls all remote changes to your local machine

(root folder) git add . -- adds all files/folders to a new commit

(root folder) git commit -m "<message text>" -- creates a new local version and gives it the name you put in the message text

(root folder) git push origin main -- pushes all the files to your GitHub repo, in the main branch


BEST PRACTICES FOR BRANCHING
- when working with a team, you won't push to the main branch
- you'll create your own branch from wherever the main branch is at that time
- then work in your own branch, push that to GitHub
- then, when code is reviewed, you'll merge it into the main branch
- these side branches are often called "feature branches"

git branch -- lists all the branches available locally (the one you're currently on will have an asterisk

git branch <name> -- creates a new branch with the given name, copied from whatever branch you're on at the time

git checkout <name> -- switches to whichever branch you name

(git add . and git commit -m <text> still apply within whatever branch)

git push origin <branch name> -- pushes to GitHub in a new branch

- after pushing to the remote, initiate a pull request in GitHub to start the process of merging your new branch with the main branch

- then, once the pull request is approved and complete, you're free to delete your branch on GitHub if you don't need it

- then, locally, checkout the main branch and pull it to get the updates

git branch -d <branch name> -- deletes the local branch
