GIT AND GITHUB

- git is a version-control piece of software
- it runs locally on your machine
- you can save out multiple versions of a project
- you can checkout different versions and work on them separately
- you have the ability to roll back to earlier versions, merge versions, selectively add things to other versions, branch off, etc.

- GitHub is an online code repository
- it can back up your local software
- it also easily enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase
