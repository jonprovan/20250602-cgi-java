		// OPERATORS IN JAVA
		
		/*
		 * MATHEMATICAL
		 * 
		 * + -- addition, like 3 + 4
		 * - -- subtraction
		 * / -- division
		 * * -- multiplication
		 * % -- modulus or modulo, returns the remainder of a division operation, so 5 % 4 returns 1
		 * = -- assignment operator, not strictly mathematical, but assigns a value to a variable, like int x = 77
		 * 
		 * To increment, I could do int i = 10; i = i + 1; i = i * 123;
		 * 
		 * ++  adds one to the value
		 * --  subtracts one from the value
		 * (for the above, it matters whether you do i++ or ++i ... will discuss later)
		 * 
		 * += -- adds the following value to the original value, like int z = 10; z += 10, now the value of z == 20
		 * -=
		 * /=
		 * *=
		 * %=		 
		 * 
		 * Exponents don't have a default operator, but you'd do something like Math.pow(3, 4)
		 * 
		 * 
		 * COMPARISON
		 * these return a boolean value
		 * 
		 * == -- are the two values equal? like if (i == 5), etc.
		 * < -- less than
		 * > -- greater than
		 * <= -- less than or equal to
		 * >= -- greater than or equal to
		 * ! -- not
		 * != -- not equal to
		 * 
		 * to use some of these in combination, you'd do something like if (!(x <= 4))
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * LOGICAL/RELATIONAL
		 * these require that the things on either side are already booleans!
		 * for example, this doesn't work -- 3 && 4
		 * but this does -- x == 3 && y == 4
		 * 
		 * these two shortcut if they return an answer after the first statement
		 * && -- and
		 * || -- or
		 * these two check both sides regardless
		 * & -- bitwise and
		 * | -- bitwise or
		 * ^ -- XOR or exclusive or, meaning ONLY one or the other is true but NOT BOTH!
		 * 
		 * if you want to do NAND (not and), NOR (not or), etc., you have to do them longhand
		 * if (!(x == 5 && z == 11))
		 *
